== File stuff ==
- Import
- Export

== UX things ==
- Hover popup (popover?) indicating some help text.
- Something to show setting details (path where stuff is stored, version, things like that)
- Make it possible to use keyboard inputs
- Dark theme??? Either configurable or just only dark mode.
- Filtering on items (something like control+F?)
- Choose between showing the cards in blocks or in lines (if names are small and you have a big screen, this is more efficient).
  Add buttons with <i class="fas fa-th"></i> and <i class="fas fa-bars"></i> or <i class="fas fa-th-list"></i>. You get the jist.
